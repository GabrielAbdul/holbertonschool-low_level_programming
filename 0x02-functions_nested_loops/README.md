- Prints the aplhabet in lowercase followed by a new line.
## 2-print\_alphabet\_x10
Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: void print\_alphabet\_x10(void);
- Prints 10 times the alphabet in lowercase followed by a new line. Only uses \_putchar twice.
## 3-islower
Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
- Prototype: int \_islower(int c);
- Returns 1 if c is lowercase
- Returns 0 otherwise
## 4-isalpha

- Prototype: int \_isalpha(int c);
- Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
- Returns 0 otherwise
## 5-sign
Write a function that prints the sign of a number.
- Prototype: int print\_sign(int n);
- Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
- Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
- Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero
## 6-abs
Function that computes taht value of an integer
- Prototype: int \_abs(int);
## 7-print\_last\_digit
Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
- Prototype: int print\_last\_digit(int);
- Returns the value of the last digit
## 8-jack\_bauer
Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
- Prototype: void jack\_bauer(void);
## 9-times\_table
Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
- Prototype: void times\_table(void);
## 10-add
Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
- Prototype: int add(int, int);
## 11-print\_to\_98
Write a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: void print\_to\_98(int n);
- Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space
- Numbers should be printed in order
- The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
- The last printed number should be 98
- You are allowed to use the standard library
## 100-times\_table
 Write a function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.
- Prototype: void print\_times\_table(int n);
- If n is greater than 15 or less than 0 the function should not print anything
## 101-natural
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Write a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.
- You are allowed to use the standard libraryou are allowed to use the standard library
## 102-fibonacci
Write a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
- The numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space.
- You are allowed to use the standard library
## 103-fibonacci
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, write a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms, followed by a new line.
- You are allowed to use standard library.
## 104-fibonacci
Write a program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
- The numbers should be separated by comma, followed by a space ,
- You are allowed to use the standard library
- You are not allowed to use any other library (You cant use GMP etc)
- You are not allowed to use long long, malloc, pointers, arrays/tables, or structures
- You are not allowed to hard code any Fibonacci number (except for 1 and 2)
