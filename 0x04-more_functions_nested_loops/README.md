# 0x04. More Functions and Nested Loops

## 0. isupper
Write a function that checks for an uppercase character
- Prototype: int \_isupper(int c)
- Returns 1 if c is uppercase, 0 otherwise.
## 1. isdigit
Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
- Prototype: int \_isdigit(int c);
- Returns 1 if c is a digit
- Returns 0 otherwise
## 2. Collaboration is multiplication
Write a function that multiplies two integers.
- Prototype: int mul(int a, int b);
## 3. The numbers speak for themselves
Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: void print\_numbers(void);
- You can only use \_putchar twice in your code
## 4. I believe in numbers and sigs
Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: void print\_most\_numbers(void);
- Do not print 2 and 4
- You can only use \_putchar twice in your code
## 5. Numbers constitute the only universal language
Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: void more\_numbers(void);
- You can only use \_putchar three times in your code
## 6.  The shortest distance between two points is a straight line
Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
- Prototype: void print\_line(int n);
- You can only use \_putchar function to print
- Where n is the number of times the character _ should be printed
- The line should end with a \n
- If n is 0 or less, the function should only print \n
